data_choiceBC.csv - concatenated data from all 6 subejcts for 11 sessions. Copied from alldata>data_task>pilot5_fmri_1>data_experiment>results. I believe it was created using createDataBC.m in the same directory that extracts and compiles all data from .mat files to .csv.
data_choiceYN.csv - concatenated data from all 6 subjects for 11 sessions. Copied from alldata>data_task>pilot5_fmri_1>data_experiment>results. I changed the file name from data_choice.csv to data_choiceYN.csv to match the format of the Binary Choice task data file name. I believe it was created using createDataYN.m in the same directory that extracts and compiles all data from .mat files to .csv.
